The Sleep-EDF-20 dataset is built based on the sleep records of 20 research participants, with the goal of classifying each 30-second segment of EEG data into one of five sleep stages. For each record in the dataset, we provide the m sampled data points from the 30-second EEG segment, as well as the corresponding sleep stage label. The values represent the voltage at a specific time, measured in microvolts (μV), with a range of [-200, 200].

Now, I provide you with the following example: (Y_prefix, S), where each example contains 60 sampled data points from a 30-second EEG segment, as well as the associated sleep stage label. Please use the temporal relationships of the values and the features of the sleep stages to help me generate the subsequent m-n values. No other descriptions are necessary—just provide the m-n generated values.
